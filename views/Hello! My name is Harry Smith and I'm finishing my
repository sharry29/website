Hello! My name is Harry Smith and I'm finishing my MS at Columbia University in December. I'm currently exploring employment & internship opportunities for this Spring and beyond in areas of Data Visualization and design. You can see my CV and portfolio at my site https://ourpropeller.com . I'd love to hear from you if you have any opportunities! I did a presentation on your studio last year in my Data Viz course and I was enamored with your print designs, so it would be exciting to be able to join your team!

Best,
Harry
