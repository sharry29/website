          I'm currently a Master's student at Columbia University studying
          Computer Science. My coursework is focused on Machine Learning and
          Natural Language Processing, but my primary interests are in CS
          education, Data Visualization, and creative computing.

              Who was the best of the best in the 2010s? How did recent songs
              contend against tracks from the beginning of the decade? What
              labels were the constant hitmakers? Was this the decade of truly
              independent music? Check this out to find out!

            <li>
              Are you better at reasoning about probabilities than your doctor?
              You'd hope so, since medical testing for diagnosing is just a game
              of conditional probability. This is an interactive explainer for
              why it's difficult to diagnose rare diseases even with nearly
              perfect medical equipment.

              An exploration of the relative strength of NBA teams through time,
              using FiveThirtyEight's ELO data. A nice bonus of the
              visualization is the ability to see teams pop up, disappear, and
              move across the country. The linked Observable notebook contains a
              brief recap of the ideation process for the visualization as well.

              >Stylometry in the Modern Era: Coreference and Voice for
              Authorship Attribution</a
            >
            <li>
              What factors determine an author's voice in writing? We used state
              of the art NLP techniques to define features that can be used to
              quantify the notion of authorial style. In particular, we explored
              how constructs like passive voice usage and entity coreference
              patterns create an author's signature literary fingerprint. Our
              data came from the Guardian's opinion pieces and book reviews over
              the past decade, so this particular experiment was performed in
              the domain of non-fiction. Co-authored with Samuel Sharpe, Justin
              Cho.

            <li>
              The ability for computers to create and understand human-readable
              source code is an attractive goal with profound implications for
              software engineering and security research. In this paper, I
              provide a survey of research which has attempted to generate or
              learn programs using Neural Networks and evaluate strengths and
              weaknesses of each. Additionally, I formalize an extention to the
              promising work done by
              <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01989">DeepCoder </a> that
              incorporates a Graph Neural Network into the inductive framework.

              Program Synthesis.
